#### What Are Fields?

**Fields** are specialized, reusable input components in Shaddy forms, designed to handle various types of user input efficiently and consistently.

A **Field** acts as a wrapper around any form input element—whether it’s a standard `<input>` or a completely custom component. Wrapping your inputs in a Field ensures they follow a consistent structure and behavior across your forms.

All Shaddy form field components use the `field` prefix (e.g., `TextField`, `PasswordField`) for easy identification and better developer experience. This naming convention helps you quickly locate and reuse components when building or maintaining forms.

Every field component follows a consistent pattern:

- Accepts a **generic type** for strong TypeScript support.
- Receives a `control` property from `useFormContext()` to integrate seamlessly with `react-hook-form`.
- Can be customized or extended to meet specific use cases.

#### Why Separate Fields?

Fields are designed to be **modular** and **purpose-driven**. For example:

- **`TextField`** can handle all text-based inputs, with optional customizations.
- **`PasswordField`** extends this functionality with additional features such as a show/hide password toggle icon.
- **`SubmitButton`** and **`ResetButton`** are both buttons, but they’re separated based on their respective actions for clarity and maintainability.

By separating responsibilities, forms remain **highly customizable**, **efficient**, and **easy to work with**.

#### Creating a Custom Field

If you’re using **React** or **Next.js** with **shadcn/ui**, creating a custom field is much easier. Below is an example of a generic `PasswordField` component that integrates with `react-hook-form` and follows Shaddy’s field pattern:

```tsx
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import { Eye, EyeOff } from "lucide-react";
import { useState } from "react";
import { FieldValues, Path, useFormContext } from "react-hook-form";
import {
  FormControl,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage,
} from "@/components/ui/form";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";

type PasswordFieldProps<T extends FieldValues> = {
  name: Path<T>;
  label?: string;
  required?: boolean;
  className?: string;
  /** Extend with additional custom props if needed */
};

/**
 * A generic, reusable password input field.
 * Validation is handled externally (e.g., via Zod schemas).
 */
export const PasswordField = <T extends FieldValues>({
  name,
  label,
  required,
  className,
}: PasswordFieldProps<T>) => {
  const { control } = useFormContext<T>();

  return (
    <FormField
      control={control}
      name={name}
      render={({ field }) => (
        <FormItem className={cn(className)}>
          {label && (
            <FormLabel>
              {label}
              {required && <span className="text-red-500 ml-1">*</span>}
            </FormLabel>
          )}

          <FormControl>
            {/* Insert your input or component logic here */}
          </FormControl>

          <FormMessage />
        </FormItem>
      )}
    />
  );
};
```
