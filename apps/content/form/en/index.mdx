### What Are React Hooks?

Have you ever wanted to make your websites or apps smarter and easier to build? React hooks help you do exactly that! Hooks are special tools in React (a popular way to build websites) that let you manage state, handle side effects, and share logic between components, all within simple JavaScript functions.

Before hooks, you had to use class components, which were harder to manage. Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` make your code cleaner, easier to understand, and more maintainable. They enable you to build complex UIs with less effort by organizing logic into reusable functions.


### Why Use Hooks?

React <Link href="https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks">Hooks</Link> help you share logic across different parts of your app without duplicating code. This modularity improves reusability, simplifies testing and debugging, and encourages a functional programming style that scales well as your app grows.


### Custom Hooks

Custom hooks are your own reusable tools, functions that let you extract logic that would otherwise be repeated across components. For example, you might create a custom hook to manage form inputs, fetch data, or handle authentication.

They help keep your components focused on rendering UI, while abstracting away complex behavior into easy to maintain logic.


### What is Typed Hooks?

Typed Hooks is a simple library offering a collection of fully typed, reusable React hooks built for TypeScript. It helps you catch mistakes before they happen, write safer code, and move faster with autocomplete and type checking.

Typed Hooks is lightweight, easy to integrate, and includes the most commonly used hooks so you don't have to rewrite boilerplate logic in every new project.


### Why Should You Use Typed Hooks?

- **Type Safe:** Built with TypeScript to help you catch bugs early and improve code quality.
- **Modular:** Pick only the hooks you need, no bloat.
- **Reliable:** Battle tested in real projects and follows best practices.
- **Developer Friendly:** Simple APIs and helpful type hints make development smoother.

Whether you're prototyping or building a production app, Typed Hooks gives you a handy set of tools to write better, faster, and safer React code.
