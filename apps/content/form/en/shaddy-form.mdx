title: Shaddy Form
description: A generic, schema-driven React form component for scalable and maintainable form management.
---

`ShaddyForm` is a reusable React component that simplifies form creation and management. It leverages `react-hook-form` for state and validation, and uses Zod schemas for type-safe validation. By providing a schema, initial values, and a submit handler, you can quickly generate forms without repetitive boilerplate.

To create a form, simply provide a schema and a submit handler. ShaddyForm will generate the form for you, eliminating the need for boilerplate code. You can also customize the layout to fit your requirements.

If you need access to the form instance outside the form context, use the `ref` prop to retrieve it.

### Key Features

- **Schema-based validation:** Uses Zod for robust, type-safe validation.
- **Reusable and extensible:** Easily integrate with any UI and extend with custom fields.
- **Imperative handle:** Exposes the form instance via a ref for advanced use cases.
- **Flexible validation modes:** Supports `onChange`, `onBlur`, `onSubmit`, and `all`.

ShaddyForm acts as a wrapper component for creating forms efficiently.
