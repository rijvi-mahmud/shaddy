Initially, we planned to create a custom context to manage Shaddy form state. However, we discovered that `react-hook-form`'s `useFormContext` already provides a robust solution for managing form state and validation.

This file exists because, when using Shaddy form, there are situations where we utilize `useFormContext` to manage the form state and validation.
