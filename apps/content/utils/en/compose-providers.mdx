`ComposeProviders` is a utility for combining multiple context providers into a single provider. It accepts an array of providers and returns a new provider that renders all of the provided providers in the correct order.

### Provider Hell Problem

When building React apps, you often need to use multiple context providers (e.g., Theme, Auth, Localization, etc.). Nesting them manually can quickly become messy and hard to maintain:

```jsx
<AuthProvider>
  <ThemeProvider>
    <LocalizationProvider>
      <SomeComponent />
    </LocalizationProvider>
  </ThemeProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

As your app grows, this "provider hell" makes your root component harder to read and update.

### Why Compose Providers?

`ComposeProviders` solves this by letting you combine all your providers into a single, reusable component. This keeps your code clean and easy to manage.

### Example Usage

Suppose you have three providers:

```jsx
import { AuthProvider } from './auth'
import { ThemeProvider } from './theme'
import { LocalizationProvider } from './localization'
import { composeProviders } from '@/utils/compose-providers'

const AppProviders = composeProviders([
  AuthProvider,
  ThemeProvider,
  LocalizationProvider,
])

// Use AppProviders at the root of your app
<AppProviders>
  <App />
</AppProviders>
```

Now, you only need to wrap your app with `AppProviders`, and all contexts are available!

### Passing Props to Providers

`composeProviders` also supports providers that require props. You can pass a tuple `[Provider, props]` for each provider that needs props:

```jsx
const AppContainer = composeProviders([
  ErrorBoundary,
  // Providers with props
  [
    QueryClientProvider,
    {
      client: queryClient,
    },
  ],
  [
    IntlProvider,
    {
      locale,
      messages,
    },
  ],
  BrowserRouter,
])

// Usage
<AppContainer>
  <App />
</AppContainer>
```

This makes it easy to configure providers like `QueryClientProvider` or `IntlProvider` that need props, while keeping your provider setup clean and maintainable.

### Benefits

- **Cleaner code:** No more deeply nested providers.
- **Easier maintenance:** Add or remove providers in one place.
- **Reusable:** Use the composed provider anywhere in your app.
