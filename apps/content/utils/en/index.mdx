title: Utils
description: Reusable TypeScript, ReactJS, and NextJS utility functions.
---

Utility functions are commonly used, reusable pieces of code that can save hours of development time and reduce code duplication across a project.

We designed our utils feature to provide a set of common utility functions that are frequently needed in any web project. These functions are simple, composable, and easy to use, allowing developers to focus on building their applications without reinventing the wheel.

A well-known library in this space is [`lodash`](https://lodash.com/), which offers a wide range of utility functions for manipulating arrays, objects, strings, and more. Lodash is widely used in the JavaScript community for its performance and ease of use.

However, our goal is not to create another Lodash. Instead, we focus on developing utilities that Lodash or other utility libraries do not cover, or to improve upon them where we believe we can offer better code, logic, or documentation.
