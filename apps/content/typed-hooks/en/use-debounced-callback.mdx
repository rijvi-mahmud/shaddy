`useDebouncedCallback` is a powerful custom React hook that creates a debounced version of a callback function, preventing excessive function calls in scenarios like search inputs, window resizing, or handling rapid user interactions.

Unlike traditional debounce utilities, this hook is specifically designed for React's lifecycle and includes additional control functions for managing the debounced state. It also properly handles changes to the callback function reference through React's renders.
