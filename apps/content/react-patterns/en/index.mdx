### Introduction

React patterns are proven solutions to common problems in React application development. As applications grow in complexity, understanding and applying the right patterns becomes crucial for maintainability, performance, and developer productivity. These patterns help structure code, manage state, handle side effects, and optimize rendering.

### The Challenge

Modern React applications often face challenges like prop drilling, state management complexity, code reusability, and performance optimization. Without proper patterns, codebases can become difficult to maintain, test, and scale. Teams need consistent approaches to solve recurring problems efficiently.

### Existing Solutions

The React ecosystem offers various patterns like Higher-Order Components (HOCs), Render Props, Compound Components, and Hooks. While these patterns are powerful, knowing when and how to apply them requires understanding their trade-offs and best practices.

### Our Approach

We provide clear, practical examples of React patterns with real-world use cases. Each pattern includes detailed explanations, code examples, and guidance on when to use them. Our goal is to help developers write cleaner, more maintainable React code.

### What are React Patterns?

React Patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in React development. They include component composition patterns, state management approaches, performance optimization techniques, and code organization strategies. These patterns help us build robust, scalable applications following industry best practices.

### Features
